​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Jquery
​
### What I learned
​
I learned more how to be more interactive using Javascript. I learned how to use Jquery and Bootstrap. With the help of the documentation, I was able to implement styles using different classes. In addition, I also learned how to target html elements, class, and css attributes using Jquery. I also learned how to store data in local storage on the browser. 
​
### Continued development
​
I would like to learn more about local storage and how to save several occurence, not just the previous event. I have difficulty saving objects in local storage. I also enjoyed using bootstrap, so I would like to continue using it in the future. 
​
